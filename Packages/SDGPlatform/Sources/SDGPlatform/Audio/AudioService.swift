// AudioService.swift
// SDGPlatform · Audio
//
// An `AVAudioPlayer` pool that plays short SFX cues (`AudioEffect`).
//
// ## Why AVAudioPlayer rather than AVAudioEngine / PHASE?
//
// Phase 2 Alpha ships fire-and-forget 2-D SFX with no spatialisation,
// no ducking, no DSP. `AVAudioPlayer` handles that surface with a
// tiny API and no graph setup. When spatial / HRTF needs appear
// (Phase 3 per GDD §2.1), the façade (`play(_:volume:)`) can be
// re-implemented on top of `AVAudioEngine` without churning callers.
//
// ## Why @MainActor?
//
// `AVAudioPlayer` is *not* `Sendable`. iOS 18's Swift 6 concurrency
// flags every non-`@MainActor` hold of an `AVAudioPlayer` reference
// as unsafe if it crosses a suspension point. Binding the whole
// service to `@MainActor` gives us one consistent isolation and
// matches the call sites: both SwiftUI handlers and RealityKit
// `SceneUpdateContext` run on `MainActor` anyway.
//
// ## Why no singleton?
//
// AGENTS.md Rule 2. The app entry point constructs one `AudioService`
// and injects it via `AppEnvironment`. Tests construct fresh ones.
//
// ## Pool strategy
//
// One cached `AVAudioPlayer` per candidate URL. First `play(effect:)`
// lazily loads the player(s); subsequent calls reuse them. If the
// cached player is still playing when another request arrives, we
// fork a temporary player (single-use) rather than cut the first one
// short — that matches the way fighting-game SFX overlap. Temporary
// players are released once they finish via the delegate callback.
